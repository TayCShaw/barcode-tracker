3/31/19:
--Fixed the AddItemController class. Done with that page for this version
of this program until more testing is done and more problems are found.

LEFT OFF ON:
--Handing errors in the RemoveItemController class. Handling
two cases that turn the same result: 
A) UPC is entered, confirm is entered, confirm hit again, but no quantity 
is entered. 
B) UPC is entered, confirm hit again, but UPC was changed. Want to handle 
that differently?

--Possibly throw a clear button on the RemoveItem.fxml page
