--Making the addition button work.
I think the thought process I had was bulk adding and adding a new item?
But the add button can just be changed to a single addition button

--The add button has two extra options: "Action 1" and "Action 2". Not sure how they got there
and not sure how to get rid of them. I feel like those are the DEFAULT options, but for some reason
they are not clearing when I add new items to the button. Removing the button and re-adding did not
fix the issue.
