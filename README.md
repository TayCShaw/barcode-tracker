# barcode-tracker

Initially started as an idea to organize our kitchen and to make grocery shopping easier. Originally completed for CPS210 as a final project for Python on Raspberry Pi (RPi). The original program was strictly console/Rpi-button based and was using dictionaries to store the item data.

Currently being reworked in Java with a working GUI. The program is based around storing items in a Microsoft Access database. As this is a personal project, I do not necessarily plan to allow for functionality beyond that. However, I may later on for a learning exercise.

The first step in the design is to make it into the original idea of organizing the kitchen/pantry, and then move onto a different type of inventory system. Possibly giving the user the ability to make multiple databases/lists of items for a household, a specific room, or for an event (e.g. making a list of items you have before moving to a new house, using that list to check off while packing up items).
