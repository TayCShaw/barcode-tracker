# barcode-tracker

Note: This branch is not the most up-to-date version of the program. This branch is meant for a semi-stable version of the program where most of the features are working. If you wish to view the current version of the program, please view the "Working" branch. Keep in mind, though, that the version of the program in the "Working" branch is the version of the program currently under construction and may include many bugs, unfinished code, and may not work.

Initially started as an idea to organize our kitchen and to make grocery shopping easier. Originally completed for CPS210 as a final project for Python on Raspberry Pi (RPi). The original program was strictly console/Rpi-button based and was using dictionaries to store the item data.

Currently being reworked in Java with a working GUI. The program is based around storing items in a Microsoft Access database. As this is a personal project, I do not necessarily plan to allow for functionality beyond that. However, I may later on for a learning exercise.

The first step in the design is to make it into the original idea of organizing the kitchen/pantry, and then move onto a different type of inventory system. Possibly giving the user the ability to make multiple databases/lists of items for a household, a specific room, or for an event (e.g. making a list of items you have before moving to a new house, using that list to check off while packing up items).
